# Angelica + Love
Love was a game for the gdja jam 1 that have been changed and included with angelica.
Angelica started as a single window chat bot project that became a multi window system with many features, and much more to come.
By now this project is about 86 days old and at this stage some things are not working like the note editor and other functions that can be found using the help command.
This Godot Engine Game Project has a lot of usefull parts that can be used in any project as a part or as a whole.
It includes many edited Godot Demos like 3D trucktown, Pong, and GDPaint.
